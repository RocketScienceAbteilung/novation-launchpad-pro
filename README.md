# novation-launchpad-pro

Support for Novation Launchpad Pro controller series in Bitwig Studio.

## tips
- Put the controller into "PROGRAM" mode by holding the "Setup" button,
pressing the orange pad, then releasing the "Setup" button.

- On Linux, choose "Launchpad Pro MIDI 2" for your input and output ports.

## todo
There are a lot of bugs and I don't know how it's "supposed" to work,
so I'm going to make this thing work however I want it to :)  As soon as it
differs significantly from the mainline project, I will give it a special
name so that you will not be confused, and will upload documentation.
